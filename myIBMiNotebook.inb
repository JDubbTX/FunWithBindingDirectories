[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"This IBM i notebook is a demonstration of how binding directories work.\n\nA binding directory is a non-source (non compiled) object that lists modules or service programs needed by an ILE Program.  While binding directories are not required, they do offer some convenience.  Specifying a binding directory in the source means that all modules / service programs needed by the program do not need to be listed in the programs creation command.\n\nLets start by compiling the module 'myModule.sqlrpgle'."},{"kind":2,"language":"cl","value":"CRTSQLRPGI OBJ(myModule) SRCSTMF('myModule.sqlrpgle') OBJTYPE(*MODULE) TEXT('FunWithBindingDirectories - Demonstration Module')"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"myModule has one exported procedure in it, 'Capitalize'.

[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"This IBM i notebook is a demonstration of how binding directories work.\n\nA binding directory is a non-source (non compiled) object that lists modules or service programs needed by an ILE Program.  While binding directories are not required, they do offer some convenience.  Specifying a binding directory in the source means that all modules / service programs needed by the program do not need to be listed in the programs creation command.\n\nLets start by compiling the module 'myModule.sqlrpgle'."},{"kind":2,"language":"cl","value":"CRTSQLRPGI OBJ(myModule) SRCSTMF('myModule.sqlrpgle') OBJTYPE(*MODULE) TEXT('FunWithBindingDirectories - Demonstration Module')"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"myModule has one exported procedure in it, 'Capitalize'.

The exported procedure is listed in the binder language for the service program, 'myServiceProgram.bnd'.  \n\nThe binder language also specifies the signature for service program. In order to create a service program, we must run a CRTSRVPGM command.
